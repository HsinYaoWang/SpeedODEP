# SpeedODEP
This is a project finished in 2020. After delayed for no reason for years, now it is available for public good.

# Highlights
- A novel microchip system can provide rapid (~2h) AST based on ODEP and AI
- Analysing bacteria with the ODEP light arrays confers characteristic AST patterns
- Accurate interpretation of the characteristic AST patterns is achieved by AI

# Abstract
Precise antibiotic use for treating infectious diseases depends on antibiotic susceptibility test (AST). However, AST typically costs several days and significantly delays the precise antibiotics use. Rapid AST method is urgently needed. Optically induced dielectrophoresis (ODEP) is one of the promising technologies that can detect bacterial characteristics (e.g. antibiotic resistance) in a rapid and accurate manner. We developed an ODEP-based microchip system to provide rapid AST. Thirteen ODEP light arrays were designed to deliver a high resolution analysis. A various of representative bacteria and antibiotics were tested on the system. Bacterial strains were incubated in high concentration antibiotic solution for a short time (antibiotic shock) to enhance the difference between resistant and susceptible strains. Based on the antibiotic shock, the bacterial strains were analysed by the ODEP light arrays in the microchip and characteristic patterns of AST were generated. We applied artificial intelligence (AI) for an objective and accurate interpretation of the AST patterns. The results showed that the optimal time of antibiotic shock was < 2h. Resistant and susceptible strains showed characteristic spatial distribution over the 13 light arrays. The AI model could classify resistant strain from susceptible strain with accuracy > 0.99. In the study, we demonstrated that an ODEP-based microchip system combined with AI could provide rapid and accurate AST that would guide a more precise antibiotic use.
